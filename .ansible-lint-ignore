# This file defines a list of ansible-lint ignore settings.
# The file format is very simple, containing the filename and the rule to be
# ignored.
# Documentation for this, and the rules available, can be found here:
# https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/rules/
# https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/usage/#muting-warnings-to-avoid-false-positives
#
# Any files and rules defined here will still cause a warning or a failure in
# ansible-lint output, which is expected behavior as of 2023-10.
# As such, this should be used as a place to document known best-practice
# violations so we can come back to them later to either improve them or fix
# the issue. This should be our first step every time.
#
# If a permanent ignore for a rule needs to be defined, it should be done one
# of three ways:
#   1. Add the rule to the skip_list in the adjacent .ansible-lint file.
#   This is *not* preferred.
#   2. Add "# noqa: [rule]" as a comment at the end of a line in a task.
#   This method will fully ignore that specific rule for that specific task.
#   You can space delineate multiple rules if required.
#   3. Add a tag of "- skip_ansible_lint" to a task.
#   Docs state this is the least preferred method as it will skip all checks.
